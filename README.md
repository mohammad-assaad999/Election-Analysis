# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
In this project, I've helped Seth and Tom to analyze and submit the election audit results to the Colorado Board of Elections. The analysis includes writing a script of codes that open a CSV file, read it, retrive data, calculate these data using some functions, formulas, and expressions, and output the results on a text file to be presented to the board.
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:

  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on populer vote.
  6. Determine the voter turnout for each county
  7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
  8. Determine the county with the highest turnout

### All the resources that were used in the project are:
  - Data Source: election_results.csv
  - Software: Python and Visual Studio Code
